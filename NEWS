  o Bug fix: as.Formula() failed for very long formulas.
  

Changes in Version 0.1-1

  o First CRAN release of package "Formula" for extended
    formula processing. This package is still under development
    and the interface might change in future versions.
  
  o Currently, this enables processing of formulas such as
      y ~ x1 + x2 | z1 + z2 + z3
    with two parts on the right hand side.
    
  o Generalization to further formulas are planned (i.e.,
    not implemented yet), e.g.,
      y1 + y2 ~ x1 + x2 + x3
      y ~ x1 + x2 | u1 | v1 + v2 + v3 | ...
    i.e., multiple responses and multi-part formulas.
